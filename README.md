# OPHO_Codes
The repository contains the codes I had written to solve some of the questions in The Online Physics Olympiad (OPhO) 2022.
The Online Physics Olympiad (OPhO) is an annual team based physics competition for both high school students and undergraduates of all levels. Although coding was not necessary for solving the questions, I did it in order to save time as some of the computations were very tedious. Not all of my answers in the file are correct and I have labelled them accordingly in the markdown of the jupyter notebook. Hence, this is only for archiving purposes and I will either add the correct codes after working them out myself or when the solutions are released by OPhO.
The computation for question 23. Resistance box is quite interesting. The trick to that question was to apply the delta to star transformation on either all the lower (or all the upper) triangular network formed in the square pattern. This leads to the creation of another set of delta loops. And after applying the delta to star transform successively or iteratively, it results in just a chain of resistors connected in series. Keep in mind that the final set of  parallel resistors won't work inside the for loop because the value of two parallel resistors is different from all the others. Hence they are written outside the loop.
